# The following commands are specific to python programming.
# Tools that you'll need for your code must be imported.
# You can import modules directly without renaming them (e.g., import os)
# Or you can import and rename things (e.g., import pandas as pd)
# Or you can import specific features of a module (e.g., from nipype.interfaces.utility import Function)
# It is traditional in python programming to import everything
# you might need at the top of your script.  However, the only rule
# is modules must be imported before they are used.  Also, functions code that begins with def nameoffunc(inputtofunc):
# require importing their own modules
